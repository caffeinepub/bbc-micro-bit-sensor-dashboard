      "featureTitle": "Create a new glassmorphism panel titled 'ATPA – Admin Transmission Ports Access' that is always visible on the dashboard. The panel displays a password input field and an 'Access' button. The correct password is '2AKFPMB0220'. While the user is not authenticated, the panel shows only the login form. On incorrect password entry, display an inline error message (e.g., 'Access Denied – Invalid Credentials'). On correct password entry, the panel transitions to an unlocked state showing the connection controls and location input described in REQ-15 and REQ-16. A 'Lock / Sign Out' button must be available in the unlocked state to return to the login form. All styling must match the existing glassmorphism design system (frosted glass, glowing borders, smooth CSS transitions). Do not modify any other panel or component.",

The ConnectionPanel must no longer appear outside the ATPA panel (i.e., its original standalone placement in App.tsx should be replaced by its presence inside the ATPA panel).
