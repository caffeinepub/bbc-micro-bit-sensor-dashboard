  "summary": "The diff implements a new ATPAPanel component with password-gated access, embeds ConnectionPanel inside it, moves ConnectionPanel out of standalone placement in App.tsx, and adds a Device Location section. The implementation closely matches all three requirements. Minor detail: the 'Lock / Sign Out' button label in the component shows 'Lock' with a LogOut icon rather than the full text 'Lock / Sign Out', but this is a cosmetic variation. All core functional requirements appear satisfied. However, index.css and tailwind.config.js were modified contrary to the explicit constraint against altering existing CSS or Tailwind config.",
