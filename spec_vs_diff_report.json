  "summary": "The diff modifies TemperaturePanel.tsx to implement the new -50°C to +110°C scale bar range as required by REQ-17. The MIN_TEMP, MAX_TEMP, and RANGE constants are set correctly, the fill width calculation uses the new range, and tick labels are updated to -50°, 0°, 50°, and 110°. Only TemperaturePanel.tsx is modified among component files. Two other files (frontend-file-summaries.txt and project_state.json) are also modified, but these appear to be documentation/metadata files reflecting the change, not functional code changes.",
