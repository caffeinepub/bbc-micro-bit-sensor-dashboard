Change the percentage fill calculation to use the new 160°C range (110 - (-50) = 160). Update any tick marks or scale labels to reflect the new bounds. Preserve all existing features: animated number display, ultra-precise display, color coding, typography, glassmorphism styling, and any other visual or behavioral aspects of the component."
